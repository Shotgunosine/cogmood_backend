## jsPsych code

In addition to all of the built-in [plugins](https://www.jspsych.org/plugins/overview/){:target="_blank"} that are distributed with jsPsych, the Niv/Daw labs have built up a library of custom plugins that are frequently used in our experiments.

A full list of these can be found in [jspsych-demos](https://github.com/nivlab/jspsych-demos){:target="_blank"}. Some useful ones include:

- A [function](https://github.com/nivlab/jspsych-demos/tree/main/tasks/audio-test){:target="_blank"} to test the participant's audio
- A [bandit task demo](https://github.com/nivlab/jspsych-demos/tree/main/tasks/bandit){:target="_blank"}
- Executive functioning tests, including the [progressive matrices](https://github.com/nivlab/jspsych-demos/tree/main/tasks/rpm) 
- and the [symmetry span](https://github.com/nivlab/jspsych-demos/tree/main/tasks/symmetry_span)
Users should feel free to add to this repository as useful tools are developed.
