# Error Codes

NivTurk anticipates specific errors that may arise during the course of an experiment. This section details those errors and the corresponding error messages participants see.

### [Code: 1000] Missing workerId

```
Sorry, we are missing your Prolific ID. Please start the experiment over from the Prolific link.
```

### [Code: 1001] Unsupported platform

```
We have detected you may be using a mobile or tablet device. Our experiment requires a
desktop device.

Please return the study or try again on a desktop computer or laptop.
```

### [Code: 1002] Decline consent

We are sorry you do not wish to complete this study.

Please return the study so someone else can perform the experiment.
```

### [Code: 1003] Technical issue

```
Sorry, there was a technical error in our processing of your study. Most likely this means
an important component of the experiment failed to load.

If you would like to receive partial compensation, or feel you have reached this page in error,
please send us a message on Prolific describing the error that you experienced.
```

### [Code: 1004] Previous participation

```
Sorry, our records indicate that you have already completed (or attempted to complete) this study.
Because this is a psychology experiment, you can only complete this study once. Please return the
study so someone else can perform the experiment.

If you would like to receive partial compensation, or if you have reached this page following an
error, please send us a message on Prolific describing the error that you experienced.
```

### [Code: 1005] Suspicious activity

```
We have detected unusual or noncompliant activity from your account. Most likely this means we
detected you were responding randomly or showing a lack of engagement with the task. Please note
that if we detect similar behavior from your account in the future, you may be permanently excluded
from all future experiments.

If you would like to receive partial compensation, or if you have reached this page following an
error, please send us a message on Prolific describing the error that you experienced.

Please return the study so someone else can perform the experiment.
