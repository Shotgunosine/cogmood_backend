# Downloading NivTurk

NivTurk is hosted in a GitHub repository and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk/releases){:target="_blank"}. You should use the Prolific 1.0 release if you plan on recruiting via Prolific, or the MTurk v1.0 release if you plan on recruiting via TurkPrime.

## Git clone

If you are comfortable working with Git at the command line, you can also clone the repo with the following commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk.git
```

The Prolific branch is the default, so if you want to use the MTurk branch you will need to switch to it after you clone the repo:

```bash
cd nivturk
git checkout mturk
```
