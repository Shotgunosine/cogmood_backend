                        The following informed consent is required by Princeton University for any person involved in a research study conducted by investigators at the University.  This study has been approved by the University's Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I understand that:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I will be presented with a series of visual stimuli on a computer screen and asked to perform simple decisions in response to these stimuli.
                            I will receive detailed instructions on how to perform the task.
                            The activities in the study carry no risk to me as they only involve operating a desktop computer.
                            The task involved in the experiment does require some mental effort.
                            I will receive no direct benefit from this research, except in so far as I may learn something about psychology and may derive satisfaction from knowing that my participation has advanced scientific understanding of human cognition.
                            I understand that the study staff will not make any clinical diagnosis based on results from this study.</li>

                        <li>My participation is voluntary, and I may withdraw my consent and discontinue participation in the project at any time.  My refusal to participate will not result in any penalty.</li>

                        <li>By indicating my consent, I do not waive any legal rights or release Princeton University, its agents, or you from liability for negligence.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        By clicking “I agree” below I am confirming that I am at least 18 years old and have read and understood this consent form.
